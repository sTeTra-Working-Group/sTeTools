Description: Biodiversity is changing. State-of-the-art research shows species
   replacement (‘turnover’) is the strongest biotic signature of global change.
   However, we don’t know whether the main trend is species replacing each other
   like-for-like or directional changes in species’ characteristics (‘traits’).
   Recent indications suggest directional changes e.g. tundra plants becoming
   woodier; fish becoming smaller. We seek general understanding of trait change
   across taxa, globally, by linking biodiversity time-series to trait-data and
   bringing together experts in trait and community change, biodiversity theory
   and modelling.
